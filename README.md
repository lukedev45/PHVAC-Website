# 🗂️ Principal HVAC Task Manager

This project is developed for **Principal HVAC** to help streamline the creation of contract timelines and improve communication between workers in different teams.

The application provides:
- Task lists with due dates and statuses  
- Notes attached to tasks to track changes or updates  
- Separate team member accounts so each worker can update their own tasks  
- Import and export of task data for easier tracking  

By replacing spreadsheets with a simple web interface, this tool enables clearer visibility of project timelines and more effective collaboration between team members.
